# Overview

This is a React Native version of my budget app.

I created this version because I wanted to learn React Native. I found React Native to be interesting because of the integration with Android, iOS, and web app simultaneously.

# Development Environment

I used React Native with Expo to create my project.

React Native uses JavaScript as programming language.
